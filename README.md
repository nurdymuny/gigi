## Plain-English primer

### What's a fiber bundle, really?

Imagine a phone book. Names are how you find an entry; the stuff about
each person — address, phone, age, occupation — is what you find when
you look them up. The names form an **index**. The stuff at each name
is the **fiber** (the values).

A fiber bundle is the same shape, taken seriously. The index is the
**base space** B. The stuff at each index point is the **fiber** F.
Every "row" in the bundle is a *section* — a way of assigning one fiber
to each base point. That's the same thing every relational DB does:
keys on one side, values on the other.

Where it changes is what GIGI does *with* that shape. Imagine the index
isn't a flat list — it's the surface of the moon. Every point on the
moon (a base point) has terrain underneath it (the fiber). The way the
terrain changes as you walk around the moon — that's **curvature**.
The presence of crater rings — that's **non-trivial topology**. If you
walk in a closed loop and end up facing a different direction than when
you started — that's **holonomy**. None of that is in the phone book.
All of it is in the moon.

GIGI treats your database like the moon, not like the phone book. Every
record is a point on a curved surface. The shape of that surface tells
you things the rows alone never could:

- **Curvature κ** at a record = *"how anomalous is this row compared to
  what's nearby?"*
- **Spectral gap λ₁** of the whole bundle = *"how clumpy or smooth is
  the data?"*
- **Holonomy** around a categorical loop = *"does this category
  implicitly twist the values somehow?"*
- **Parallel transport** between two records = *"if I had to walk from
  row A to row B along the data's natural geometry, what path would
  I take?"*
- **Confidence 1/(1+κ)** = *"how much should I trust this answer?"*

These aren't add-ons. They are **what GIGI computes during normal
operation**. Curvature updates on every insert via Welford's online
algorithm. Spectral gap is cached and incrementally refreshed.
Holonomy is a verb in the query language (`HOLONOMY corpus ...`).

The headline: **a conventional database stores rows. GIGI stores the
geometry that rows live on.** The rows are still there — every GIGI
query returns the same shape Postgres or Mongo would — but every
response also carries the geometric quantities, free, because the
substrate computed them on the way through.

### Day-one operations: GIGI vs Postgres / MySQL / Mongo

How the basics work, side by side. Every row here is a real operation
the engine implements, not an aspirational future.

| You want to… | Conventional DB | GIGI |
|---|---|---|
| **Insert one row** | Append to table, update indexes | Append + bump Welford field stats + mutation_counter + curvature; the bundle's geometry incrementally evolves |
| **Look up by primary key** | B-tree (O(log N)) or hash (O(1)) | `SECTION bundle AT (id='X');` — GIGI hash G(K₁,…,Kₘ) → ℤ₂⁶⁴, **always O(1)**; response also carries κ + confidence |
| **`WHERE x = 5`** | Index scan or full table scan | Same O(1) GIGI hash on the addressed key; with geometric annotation per result |
| **`WHERE x BETWEEN 10 AND 20`** | Range scan over a sorted index | `filtered_query` over the bundle; returns hits + per-hit position in the fiber |
| **`GROUP BY region`** | Hash-grouped aggregation | `INTEGRATE field OVER bundle COVER ALL;` — aggregation = integration over a base-space cover (geometric, not relational) |
| **`JOIN orders ON customers`** | Hash join / merge join | `PULLBACK orders ALONG customers` — pullback of one bundle along a shared base map |
| **`COUNT(*)`, `AVG(x)`, `STDDEV(x)`** | Scan, or precomputed summary tables | Welford stats maintained incrementally on every insert — **O(1) read**, never stale |
| **Detect anomalies / outliers** | Add a streaming pipeline + outlier model | Curvature κ already updated per insert; outliers are points where κ spikes — no separate pipeline |
| **"How clustered is my data?"** | Run k-means or DBSCAN offline | `SPECTRAL bundle;` — Fiedler value λ₁ from the index Laplacian, cached and incrementally refreshed |
| **"Are A and B related geometrically?"** | Foreign key + join | `TRANSPORT bundle FROM (id=A) TO (id=B) ON FIBER (...);` — explicit parallel transport, returns the SO(n) rotation matrix |
| **Encrypt sensitive columns** | Column encryption — usually breaks indexes | **Gauge encryption v0.4** preserves κ, λ₁, anomaly scores, holonomy at **native speed**. Six modes (Affine / Probabilistic / Opaque / Indexed / Isometric / Identity); SQL analytics (SUM/AVG/VAR/STDDEV exact on ciphertext via closed-form inverses); PQ-safe trusted + threshold delegation (ML-KEM-768 + Shamir K-of-N); public deterministic invariant verification (`/v1/bundles/{name}/verify_invariant`) |
| **Add a new column** | `ALTER TABLE`, schema migration, downtime | Fiber type evolves; old records remain valid sections under the wider fiber |
| **Restart the server** | Reload from disk, indexes rebuild from scratch | Reload from mmap snapshot in seconds; brain endpoints work polymorphically on the reloaded bundle (#107) |
| **"Tell me how surprising this query was"** | Build a custom logging layer | Every response includes κ, KL-divergence, JS-divergence via the `dhoom` event protocol — free |
| **"Find me an option that's close to satisfying these 5 constraints"** | Multiple WHERE queries + manual relaxation | `POST /v1/bundles/{name}/brain/sudoku` — returns solutions, near-misses with quantified relaxation cost, Pareto frontier of multi-violation alternatives, and an honest `Sat`/`Unsat`/`Unknown` verdict |
| **"What other records are geometrically nearby?"** | Vector DB + ANN index | `POST /v1/bundles/{name}/brain/sample_transport` — curvature-bounded neighborhood (`d² ≤ τ`), Efraimidis-Spirakis weighted sample, returns k records with per-candidate `curvature_k` and bundle-wide confidence |

The compounding effect: because curvature updates on every insert, you
don't have to *decide later* to add anomaly detection — it's already
running. Because spectral gap is cached, *"is this data clumpy?"* is a
constant-time read instead of an offline batch job. Because confidence
ships in every response, *"should I trust this?"* doesn't need a
separate ML stack. **Geometry is not a plugin.** It's the substrate.

### What it costs

- **Insert latency**: ~the same as a relational DB doing the same
  number of column writes. The Welford updates are O(1) per numeric
  field; the mutation_counter is a single atomic increment.
- **Memory**: ~1.5× a row-store for the same data, because the geometric
  metadata (per-field stats, fiber index, mutation epoch) lives
  alongside the records.
- **Cold-start after restart**: bundles reload from mmap snapshots in
  seconds, not the minutes a B-tree rebuild can take. Brain endpoints
  (curvature reads, SUDOKU, SAMPLE_TRANSPORT) are available immediately,
  not after a warm-up.

### What it doesn't do (yet)

- **Cross-bundle ACID transactions** — single-bundle writes are
  atomic; multi-bundle is your problem to coordinate.
- **SQL-compatible wire** — the query language is GQL (similar shape
  to SQL but with the geometric verbs above; full grammar in
  `GQL_REFERENCE.md`). SDKs in Python and JS hide the difference.
- **Sharding across nodes** — single-node engine right now. The
  fiber-bundle structure should shard cleanly along base-space
  partitions, but that work is for a later sprint.

## Why GIGI

Conventional databases see rows. GIGI sees a section σ: B → E of a fiber
bundle (E, B, F, π, Φ): the base space B is the queryable keys, the fiber
F is the value schema, and every record is a point in the total space E.
This isn't decoration — it's how the engine indexes, queries, and reasons
about your data:

| You want… | Conventional DB | GIGI |
|---|---|---|
| O(1) point query by composite key | Multi-column hash index | GIGI hash G : K₁ × … × Kₘ → ℤ₂⁶⁴ — native |
| Anomaly detection | Add a streaming pipeline | Curvature κ updated per insert; outliers fall out |
| "How clustered is this?" | Run k-means offline | Spectral gap λ₁ from the index Laplacian |
| Compute on encrypted data | Homomorphic encryption (~10,000× slowdown) | Gauge encryption — **native speed**, geometry-preserving |
| Logging with semantic insight | Text logs + sampling | DHOOM events with κ, KL-div, JS-div per query |
| NLP fiber geometry (tense, morphology, …) | Vector DB + bespoke analysis | `HOLONOMY corpus ON FIBER (f11, f12) AROUND tense_label` |
| Long-context theorems on a substrate | "trust me" + benchmarks | Kähler-upgrade catalog with cross-team math validation matching observations to rounding precision |

---

## What's new in 2026 — the Kähler upgrade

GIGI v3 shipped the **Kähler upgrade**: twelve layers (L1–L7, L8 cross-team
handoff, L9 moment maps, L10 generative flow, L11 predictive coding,
L12 attention + memory) of geometric machinery extending the fiber-bundle
substrate with a complex structure J, a closed 2-form B, and everything
that falls out of the pair — Hadamard substructure detection, holomorphic
curvature decomposition, Morse compression, line-bundle integrality checks,
quantum cohomology on toy manifolds, Berezin-Toeplitz operators,
Riemann-Roch representational capacity, moment-map / Noether conservation
along Hamiltonian B-flows, **the Friston-FEP keystone — generative flow on
the Kähler bundle that parametrizes its boundary conditions to deliver
SAMPLE / FORECAST / DREAM / RECONSTRUCT as one piece of infrastructure**,
**predictive-coding primitives stacked on top: INPAINT (constrained
Langevin for filling in missing fields), PREDICT (single Fisher-natural-
gradient step), and SELF-MONITOR (kernel-density confidence — the brain's
"I don't know" signal)**, and **the attention + memory pillar that closes
the brain-primitives catalog: ATTEND (softmax over geodesic distance),
FOCUS (top-k sub-bundle retrieval), EPISODIC (persistent-H₀ change-point
detection on time-indexed value sequences), SEMANTIC (Morse-compressed
gist wrapping L6)**. All 12 brain primitives now operational. The Kähler catalog
([`theory/kahler_upgrade/`](theory/kahler_upgrade/)) closes at **16 of 21
items shipped** — 100% of items the catalog itself classified as ship-able;
the remaining 5 (§1.6 hypersurface, §2.4 K-theory, §2.6 Floer, §2.7 mirror
symmetry, §E.4 hyperkähler) are explicitly deferred in the catalog's own
classification.

GIGI now ships **three companion catalogs**, each in the same format:

- [`theory/kahler_upgrade/`](theory/kahler_upgrade/) — the 21-item Kähler
  catalog with 16 shipped; 15/15 Python validation tests pass across
  v1–v4 suites.
- [`theory/post_kahler_directions/`](theory/post_kahler_directions/) — nine
  **post-Kähler** geometric programs (Sasaki, information geometry, OT/
  Wasserstein, persistent homology, Gromov δ-hyperbolicity, tropical,
  synthetic DG, NCG, CAT(κ)) from outside the Adachi lineage; 30/30
  numerical checks pass.
- [`theory/brain_primitives/`](theory/brain_primitives/) — the Sudoku-10×
  reading. **Twelve brain-like operations forced by one master equation**
  `ẋ = B⁻¹∇(−log p)` on the Kähler bundle — the same equation Friston
  writes down for variational free-energy minimization. One generator,
  twelve product-level primitives (SAMPLE, FORECAST, DREAM, RECONSTRUCT,
  INPAINT, PREDICT, ATTEND, FOCUS, EPISODIC, SEMANTIC, SELF-MONITOR,
  EXPLAIN); 26/26 numerical checks pass. L10 ships the keystone (gradient-
  + Hamilton-flow infrastructure); L11/L12 follow the same pattern.

Three properties are worth calling out because they're hard to find anywhere
else at this scale:

**1. Strict additivity. The optionality contract holds across all twelve layers.**
The entire Kähler upgrade lives behind a single Cargo feature flag (`kahler`).
With the feature off, the engine is **bit-identical to pre-upgrade GIGI**
— 674 tests pass, byte-equal to before the upgrade landed. With the feature
on, 821 tests pass, including a per-layer real-data smoke against the
20-record sensor dataset and a per-layer cross-team contract test
(`tests/kahler_*_marcella_contract.rs`) that fails before any consumer
deserialization can drift. Twelve layers of new math, zero breaking changes.

**2. Math predictions validated by production observation to rounding precision.**
The first downstream consumer (Marcella) ran a 30-prompt A/B harness +
10-turn deep-trace on her actual embedding substrate
(`marcella_source_embeddings_bge`, 9910 × L2-normalized 384-D vectors on
S³⁸³). Perfect monotonicity: 21/21 reply-different when the residue moved,
9/9 byte-identical when it didn't. Peak per-turn Δ-residue measured at
**0.0747**, matching the closed-form non-associativity bound of **7.6pp**
to within rounding (0.0013). The deep-trace held coherence through 86°
accumulated rotation across 10 turns — exactly 10 × 8.6° per turn, linear.

**3. Geometric machinery doing real work in user-facing behavior.**
The non-associativity meter that started as a math sanity check turned out
to be a **conversation-stationarity signal**: 4-of-4 stationary sessions
show monotonic decay at ~2pp per turn toward the calibrated floor. Same
infrastructure, two readable surfaces. Geometric structure showing up as
useful product behavior is what the substrate is for.

The full audit trail — eight per-layer commits + ~15 cross-team
correspondence docs + four Python validation suites (15/15 PASS across
v1–v4) + the per-layer contract / real-data / e2e tests — is in
[`theory/kahler_upgrade/`](theory/kahler_upgrade/) and
[`tests/kahler_*`](tests/). The language layer on top is specified in
[`GIGI_LANG_SPEC.md`](GIGI_LANG_SPEC.md) +
[`GIGI_SCHEMA_INTROSPECTION_SPEC.md`](GIGI_SCHEMA_INTROSPECTION_SPEC.md).

## What's new in late May 2026 — the SUDOKU + SAMPLE_TRANSPORT sprint

Six waves of work landed on top of the brain catalog, taking the substrate
from "we have 12 brain primitives" to "we have a constrained-inference
meta-primitive that solves real problems across unrelated domains" plus a
neighborhood-sampling primitive that answers "what other points are
geometrically reachable from here?"

The work shares the same Davis-manifold machinery as the
**sudoky-energy** sister project (Bee Davis, U.S. Provisional Patent
Feb 2026 — a GPU-accelerated CSP solver using `K_loc` curvature scheduling
+ `V(c)` information value + Γ trichotomy routing + holonomy pruning).
sudoky-energy solves canonical CSPs (Sudoku, SAT, graph coloring); GIGI's
SUDOKU primitive applies the same Čech-cohomology pre-filter and curvature
diagnostics to bundle-record filtering.

### SUDOKU — constrained inference on a learned affordance manifold

The primitive: a consumer hands SUDOKU a constraint set; it returns
satisfying records, near-miss records (records that violate exactly one
constraint), a Pareto frontier of multi-violation alternatives, a
counterfactual relaxation menu, per-constraint diagnostics, and an
**honest tristate verdict** — `Sat` / `Unsat` / `Unknown` (the last meaning
"I didn't look enough to claim either", explicit by API design; most CSP
solvers conflate empty-result with no-such-thing).

Six waves of additive geometry, all behind the `kahler` feature flag, all
free for the diagonal-metric case and Mahalanobis-ready for FitMode::Full
bundles:

| Wave | What it adds |
|---|---|
| **W3** | Per-violation `relaxation_cost` (Kähler-natural z-score = `|actual − threshold| / field_std`). Per-constraint `SelectivityReport` (marginal filter count, binding flag). `RelaxationOption` menu — counterfactual "what if I bent this rule to value X" with data-derived thresholds, sorted by gain/cost. |
| **W4** | `Solution.quality_score` — depth into the satisfaction region (soft-constraint posterior under independent half-normal priors). `Eq(Vector)` violation cost upgraded from flat 1.0 to bundle-derived L2 distance — fixes the dishonest math where geometrically close embeddings were indistinguishable from geometrically far ones. |
| **W5** | `ParetoNearMiss` — Pareto frontier on (n_violations, total_cost). Generalizes single-violation near-misses; the k=1 slice equals the existing list. Cap scales with constraint count (was incorrectly hard-capped at 3). |
| **W6.1** | `SelectivityReport.raw_curvature` — `K_c` = fraction of records that fail this constraint regardless of others. High K_c + zero marginal = **redundant constraint** (covered by another). Maps to sudoky-energy's per-variable `K_loc` scheduling signal. |
| **W6.2** | Čech-cohomology **holonomy pre-flight** — O(C²) pairwise scan for *trivially* self-contradictory constraint pairs (`Eq(x,a)+Eq(x,b)`, `Le(x,c)+Ge(x,d)` with `d>c`, `Between` intervals disjoint, `IsIn` empty intersection, etc.). Fires before any record IO, returns `Unsat` with `pre_flight_unsat_reason` populated. Provably zero false positives by construction. |
| **S3.5** | **Puzzle expansion** — when the original constraint set is UNSAT (verdict or pre-flight), opt-in `expansion: { allowed: true }` walks the relaxation menu (best gain/cost first) and stops at the first relaxation that finds ≥1 solution. Sets advisory when no relaxation works. |

**Wire surface** (single endpoint, content-negotiated DHOOM ↔ JSON):

```
POST /v1/bundles/{name}/brain/sudoku
```

Returns `solutions[]`, `near_misses[]`, `verdict`, `coverage`,
`n_records_considered`, `selectivity[]` (with `K_c`),
`relaxations[]`, `pareto_near_misses[]`, optional
`pre_flight_unsat_reason`, optional `expansion_result` — every field
data-derived, no domain configuration. The same call works on a drug-
discovery bundle, an apartment bundle, a stock-screening bundle, a
sensor bundle — verified end-to-end across 24 distinct domains in the
demo set below.

### SAMPLE_TRANSPORT — curvature-bounded neighborhood sampling

When deterministic `TRANSPORT` returns one geodesic, `SAMPLE_TRANSPORT`
returns a neighborhood of `k` valid destinations within a curvature
budget τ:

```
N(p_src, τ) = { p ∈ E : d²(p_src, p) ≤ τ }
```

where `d² = (1 - cos θ) / 2 ∈ [0, 1]` (Double-Cover half-angle formula —
`S + d² = 1`). Candidates weighted by `exp(-β · d²)`, sampled without
replacement via the **Efraimidis-Spirakis priority algorithm** (r^(1/w)
keys, top-k). Per-candidate `curvature_k = 2 · √d²`; bundle-wide
`confidence = 1 / (1 + κ)`.

```
POST /v1/bundles/{name}/brain/sample_transport
GQL:  SAMPLE_TRANSPORT bundle FROM (k=v,...) ON FIBER (...) BUDGET τ N k [BETA β] [SEED s];
```

### #107 — brain endpoints work on reloaded (mmap+overlay) bundles

Pre-existing limitation closed: every brain endpoint had the guard
`as_heap().ok_or(404 "not heap-resident")`, so after any server restart
bundles reloaded from snapshot became inaccessible until manual
recreation — Marcella's refuse-gate broke on every deploy. Fix:
`OverlayBundle::to_temp_heap_store()` materializes the merged
(mmap base − tombstones + overlay) view into a fresh heap store in
~10ms per 10k records; new `heap_or_promote` adapter dispatches —
zero cost on heap, one-shot promote on overlay. **15 brain endpoints
updated; live verified on `gigi-stream.fly.dev` after deploy
(4,961 bundles / 12.8M records reloaded with zero loss).**

### The eight worked-example demos (under `e2e/probes/`)

Each demo is self-contained — no shared schema, no shared config, just
the wire endpoint and a synthetic-but-realistic bundle. Together they
exercise every wave's functionality across **24 distinct domains**.

| Demo | What it shows |
|---|---|
| [`sudoku_six_domains_demo.py`](e2e/probes/sudoku_six_domains_demo.py) | Wave 3 baseline — drug discovery, real estate, recipes, hiring, stock screening, music playlists. Headline: relaxation cost in σ-units, binding constraint, gain-per-bend menu. |
| [`sudoku_six_more_domains_demo.py`](e2e/probes/sudoku_six_more_domains_demo.py) | Wave 4 — used cars (multi-numeric Pareto), restaurants (many-SAT quality rank), flights (timestamp-as-numeric), books, sensors (Vector Eq geometric distance), HR. Surfaced + closed two GP gaps (vector cost, quality_score). |
| [`sudoku_geometry_diagnostics_demo.py`](e2e/probes/sudoku_geometry_diagnostics_demo.py) | Waves 5 + 6.1 + 6.2 — NYC apartments (K_c curvature table) + Clinical trial eligibility (Čech pre-flight catches `age<18 AND age≥65` without walking 300 patient records). The proof that "your constraints can't both hold" is mechanically distinct from "the world doesn't have what you want". |
| [`sudoku_expansion_demo.py`](e2e/probes/sudoku_expansion_demo.py) | S3.5 — drug discovery, real estate, clinical trials, double-UNSAT. Original UNSAT, expansion relaxes cheapest constraint, finds solutions; double-UNSAT case fires the advisory cleanly. |
| [`sudoku_at_scale_demo.py`](e2e/probes/sudoku_at_scale_demo.py) | 100–1000 record bundles — NYC apartments (500), drug discovery (1000 compounds), SP500-sized stock screen (500), restaurants city-wide (300), sensor fleet (200, 8D embeddings). Real server-side latency: 7–52 ms per call. |
| [`sudoku_32x32_grid_demo.py`](e2e/probes/sudoku_32x32_grid_demo.py) | The namesake at literal scale — solves a 32×32 sudoku grid (1024 cells, 30% empty) using the SUDOKU primitive as a per-cell oracle inside a constraint-propagation loop. 300/307 cells filled correctly in **795 ms** / **1.5 ms per call**. The 7 unresolved cells are "needs backtracking" candidates where SUDOKU correctly returned ≥2 valid digits. |
| [`sample_transport_demo.py`](e2e/probes/sample_transport_demo.py) | S4 — semantic analogy (2D unit-circle corpus; "walk" finds "walked", "walking", "run", "ran" within budget=0.3), music similarity, drug analog discovery, reproducibility. 18/18 checks. |
| [`preship_audit.py`](e2e/probes/preship_audit.py) | 25-check production gate — malformed-input fuzz, memory/payload bounds, persistence smoke (insert → query → restart → re-query → identical fingerprint). All 25 pass pre- and post-#107. |

## What's new in late May 2026 — GIGI Encrypt v0.3 + v0.4 ship

The encryption surface jumped two minor versions in one window. v0.3
fleshed out the gauge-mode primitives and shipped the full delegation
family. v0.4 added the verification layer that turns the invariant
tuple into a public, deterministic audit primitive. Both are now live
on `gigi-stream.fly.dev` alongside the brain catalog.

### v0.3 — gauge-mode completion + delegation family

| Sprint | What it adds |
|---|---|
| **I** Curvature-MAC | HMAC-SHA256 over the canonical π_inv tuple (52-byte big-endian layout, 10⁻¹⁰ quantization — 4× tighter than v0.3.0 by replacing the f64 `capacity` field with a u64 `record_count`). Tag changes iff the bundle's *invariants* change, regardless of gauge. |
| **J.1** Aff(ℝ) delegation | Compose two `GaugeKey`s' Affine / Isometric / Identity transforms into a per-field capability the proxy applies on ciphertext. Honestly labeled: **not collusion-resistant** (Bob + capability + own key recovers Alice's key) — this is *capability delegation*, not PRE. |
| **J.2** Pairing-based PRE | BLS12-381 — Ateniese-Hohenberger 2005 construction. Single-party Alice→Bob with delegatee-vs-proxy collusion resistance reducing to DLP on G₂ (~2^128 work). Pre-quantum by design. |
| **J.3** ML-KEM trusted delegation | FIPS 203 ML-KEM-768 (post-quantum KEM, NIST Level 3) wraps a session secret to the recipient; AES-256-GCM-SIV AEAD encrypts the payload under the KEM-derived key. Trust model: trusted delegatee. Closes the BLS12-381 quantum gap. |
| **J.4** Lattice threshold delegation | Two-layer composition: Shamir K-of-N split over the secp256k1 base field F_p (info-theoretic on ≤K−1 subsets) + per-share ML-KEM-768 envelope (PQ IND-CCA outer layer). Closes the **PQ + collusion-resistance** gap structurally for the K-of-N quorum trust model. |
| **K** Holonomy ledger | RFC 6962 Merkle audit log over per-write leaves; gauge-invariant. |
| **L** Čech threshold | Same Shamir-over-F_p that J.4 reuses, surfaced as a primitive for non-delegation use cases (gauge-key escrow, secret-of-secret recovery). |
| **M** RG-flow ratchet | HKDF chain for continuous forward secrecy on the integrity key. |
| **aggregate_helpers** | Client-side closed-form inverters for COUNT / SUM / AVG / VAR / STDDEV on Affine + Probabilistic gauges. Server runs native aggregates over ciphertext; client recovers plaintext via one affine inverse — **native server speed + O(1) client post-processing** (vs ~10³–10⁵× slowdown for FHE on the same query class). |

**Honest carveout shipped with v0.3** (review-driven, see paper §1.4):
`decrypt_min` / `decrypt_max` / `decrypt_range` **refuse** Probabilistic
gauges with σ > 0 — order statistics don't commute with additive
Gaussian noise. Bias is `Θ(σ √(2 log n) / |a|)` and doesn't vanish as
n → ∞. Callers who accept the bias for coarse bounds opt in via the
explicit `*_unchecked` variants. The Rust rigor suite
`tests/fhe_pq_parity_rigor.rs` (25 tests) and the Python oracle
`validation_tests_fhe_pq_rigor.py` (66/66) lock the behavior in.

### v0.4 — invariant verification + the four follow-up sprints

| Sprint | What it adds | Surface |
|---|---|---|
| **N** Invariant Consistency Verification | Public deterministic verification that a prover's claimed π_inv = (K, λ₁, ⟨Hol⟩, τ, β₀, β₁) agrees with the bundle's computed tuple. **No gauge key required** — every component is invariant under v0.2+ modes. **Bundle-id binding** enforced at API + HTTP layers (closes review Gap 1: a claim about bundle A presented against bundle B is rejected on identity grounds before any tuple computation). | `POST /v1/bundles/{name}/verify_invariant` — body carries `{bundle_id, claimed, tolerances?}`, response is tagged `verdict ∈ {verified, bundle_mismatch, rejected}` with the first failing field named in fingerprint order. |
| **O** Credential-Gated Invariant Queries | HMAC-SHA256-bound credentials today; constant-time tag comparison; typed domain separator. BBS+ unlinkability pinned as the v0.5 upgrade target (Au-Susilo-Mu 2006 / Beullens-Dobson-Katsumata 2023 lattice-BBS path). | Falsification harness `is_in_IAff()` + parser-by-construction; adversarial K_fake = mean/std² caught at relative error 0.59 under any gauge. |
| **Q** K-Preserving Transformation Characterization | Identifies the **diagonal affine group** `(ℝ*)ᵏ ⋉ ℝᵏ` as the exact K-preserving subgroup (corrected from earlier scalar-only overclaim). Rotation analysis: `tr(Cov)/diam²` is rotation-invariant; `(max−min)²` is not. LWE separation: hiding layer ≠ gauge action. **Roadmap only — not a shipped PQ mode.** | `is_K_preserving_affine()`, `characterize_K_preserving_group()`. PQ-Scalar deferred until the lattice-PRE construction question (open; closest prior work Kirshanova 2014 / Aono-Hayashi 2017) is resolved. |
| **P** Geodesic-Ball Membership Index | Chi-square / Mahalanobis dimension-aware threshold (**exact-table** for k ∈ {1..5} × p ∈ {0.95, 0.99} — χ²(1, 0.95) = 3.841 returns *exactly*; Wilson-Hilferty fallback for everything else). Scalar isotropic gauge preserves ball membership; field-wise affine requires the ellipsoidal Mahalanobis condition (documented). **Explicit leakage scope**: index reveals centroid + covariance + count; not a hiding primitive. | `GeodesicBallIndex` with `membership_check()` / `encrypted_membership_scalar()` / `encrypted_membership_fieldwise()`. |

**Cross-validation discipline:** every Sprint N–P primitive has a
parallel Python oracle in `theory/encryption/validation/`. Rust + Python
agree to 1e-10 on every cross-checked assertion.

### The paper

**Published on Zenodo, 2026-05-29:** Davis, B. R. (2026). *Geometric Encryption: Property-Preserving Database Encryption via Gauge Invariance on Fiber Bundles.* Zenodo. [10.5281/zenodo.20438796](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20438796). 28 pp, 731 KB PDF. Twelve worked Alice/Bob examples in Appendix A; per-mode leakage profiles (Affine / Opaque / Indexed / Probabilistic / Isometric) graded under the Chase-Kamara structured-encryption taxonomy; formal BDH security reduction for BLS12-381 pairing-PRE; lattice-threshold + ML-KEM-768 PQ delegation modes.

Source: [`theory/encryption/paper_geometric_encryption_v0.1.tex`](theory/encryption/paper_geometric_encryption_v0.1.tex). Two review-driven carveouts:

1. **§1.4 FHE parity scope** — plaintext-exact for {COUNT, SUM, AVG,
   VAR, STDDEV} under both Affine and Probabilistic modes, and for MIN
   / MAX / RANGE under Affine. Probabilistic MIN/MAX/RANGE is biased
   and refused at the API.
2. **§1.4 Threshold vs pairing-PRE** — *mode-dependent*: lattice
   threshold (J.4) dominates on the K-of-N quorum axis (PQ +
   info-theoretic on ≤K-1 subsets); pairing PRE (J.2) covers the
   single-delegatee axis (DLP_G₂-hard but pre-quantum). The true PQ
   single-delegatee construction is the v0.5 lattice-PRE target.

## What's new — 2026-05-30 — Cognitive Geometry verbs (Branch VII)

**CAPACITY · HORIZON · DEPTH · PERCEIVE — the four Cognitive Geometry verbs from Davis's *Cognitive Geometry Correspondence* (Branch VII, Theorems 8.1 / 8.6 / 8.14).** Where the older Kähler analytics expose static geometric scalars (K, λ₁, holonomy_debt, …), the CG verbs translate those into builder-facing routing decisions: *can the substrate hold this interpretation?* (CAPACITY = τ/K), *how deep does coherent context extend before the accumulated frame rotation becomes irrecoverable?* (HORIZON = τ/(K·ℓ_c)), *what's the erasure energy of writing here?* (DEPTH classifier I/II/III/IV), and *what does the substrate actually perceive this vector to be after parallel transport, and how much should we trust that perception?* (PERCEIVE = (R_acc·v, ‖R_acc−I‖_F)). All four ship with HTTP endpoints (`GET /v1/bundles/{name}/capacity`, `…/horizon`, `…/depth`, `POST …/perceive`), GQL verbs (e.g. `PERCEIVE bundle ROTATION (r00, r01, …) VECTOR (v0, v1, …) [DIM N]`), backwards-compatible config surfaces (`HorizonConfig` with `LengthScaleEstimator` SpectralGap/WelfordRadius/Fixed; `DepthConfig` with substrate-aware constructors `for_graph_substrate()`/`for_continuous_substrate()`/`auto_for(store, eps)`), and a JTBD demo (`cargo run --features kahler --bin cognitive_geometry_demo`) showing all four verbs on real-sensor + synthetic-volatile bundles side-by-side. The DEPTH `auto_for` calibration fixes the JTBD case where sensor-style bundles with λ₁ ≈ 0 collapsed to Topological regardless of K; the HORIZON Welford-radius fallback fixes the case where HORIZON degenerated to CAPACITY when λ₁ = 0; the PERCEIVE chain reads `R_acc` from `flat_transport`'s new `TransportResult.rotation` field so consumers can call `perceive(&result.rotation.unwrap(), &v, dim)` directly. 35 new tests (8 PERCEIVE math, 3 R_acc on transport, 6 GQL parser, 5 HTTP contract, 13 real-data smoke / contract) plus the existing 30 integration test files all pass — 1082 lib tests with `kahler`, 841 no-feature, 0 regressions. Marcella reads CAPACITY/HORIZON in her retrieval router; DEPTH gates write strategy; PERCEIVE feeds the COHERENCE_SIGNAL_SPEC §3 windowed-holonomy δ_t signal as the GIGI-side analogue of the rotation accumulated by her prefix scan.

## What's new — 2026-05-29 — encryption paper deposit + vector-search cache

**Geometric Encryption paper deposited on Zenodo.** Davis, B. R. (2026). *Geometric Encryption: Property-Preserving Database Encryption via Gauge Invariance on Fiber Bundles.* Zenodo. [10.5281/zenodo.20438796](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20438796). The v1 PDF (28 pp, 731 KB) covers Theorem 3.3 (ρ-equivariant ciphertext-computability over general answer spaces `Y_f`), the five-mode taxonomy (Affine / Opaque / Indexed / Probabilistic / Isometric) with explicit per-mode leakage profiles graded under the Chase-Kamara structured-encryption taxonomy, the v0.3 cryptographic suite (Curvature-MAC, Aff(ℝ) capability delegation, Holonomy ledger, Čech threshold sharing, continuous RG-flow ratchet, BLS12-381 pairing PRE with formal BDH reduction, ML-KEM-768 trusted-delegatee, lattice K-of-N threshold delegation), and the v0.4 follow-ups (public deterministic verification of π_inv, credential-gated invariant queries, geodesic-ball membership index, K-preserving group characterization). Appendix A walks twelve worked Alice/Bob examples end to end. The marketing page at [davisgeometric.com/gigi/gigi-encrypt](https://davisgeometric.com/gigi/gigi-encrypt) carries an interactive in-browser demo: pick a dataset, set a secret gauge `(a, b)`, run `SUM`/`AVG`/`MIN`/`MAX`/`VAR`/`STDDEV`/`COUNT` on ciphertext, and watch the closed-form `ρ⁻¹` recover the plaintext aggregate.

**New `vector_cache` module** ([`src/vector_cache.rs`](src/vector_cache.rs)). General-purpose primitive backing the vector-search brain endpoints (`/brain/intent_gate`, `/brain/confidence`, `/brain/confidence_with_explain`). Cached `(N, D)` materialized matrices with mutation-counter invalidation and per-key single-flight compute on miss — same architecture as `BundleFlowCache`. `MaterializedMatrix` holds contiguous row-major `Vec<f64>` plus precomputed per-row squared L2 norms; distance queries use the cosine identity `‖q − r‖² = ‖q‖² + ‖r‖² − 2⟨q, r⟩` in one autovectorizable inner loop. `CachedMatrix` carries a lazy per-bandwidth `max_density` cache so `confidence_normalized`'s `O(N²·D)` denominator is computed once per (matrix, bandwidth) and reused. Public helpers: `kde_raw_from_matrix`, `max_density_cached`, `kde_normalized_cached`, `MaterializedMatrix::nearest`, `MaterializedMatrix::d_sq_to_all`. New operator-facing env var `GIGI_VECTOR_CACHE_SIZE` (default 64) for capacity tuning. 21 new unit tests gating matrix math against a naive reference + the cache lifecycle (miss → hit → invalidate, eviction at capacity, field-order disambiguation, per-key compute-lock isolation, per-bandwidth cache separation).

| `observability` | Geometric logs (κ, KL, JS per query) |
| `convert` | JSON / CSV / SQL → DHOOM ingestion |

Plus the Kähler-feature modules (gated on `--features kahler`; absent paths are bit-identical to the pre-upgrade engine):

| Module | What it does | Layer |
|---|---|---|
| `geometry::complex_structure` | `ComplexStructure` (J² = -I, enforced) | L1 |
| `geometry::forms` | `TwoForm` + `ClosedTwoForm` with discrete dB closedness check | L1 |
| `geometry::transport` | B-perturbed magnetic transport via RK4; cyclotron-conserving | L1.5 |
| `geometry::hadamard` | Hadamard substructure detection + `transport_along` / `transport_inverse` | L5 |
| `geometry::line_bundle` | `LineBundle` + Dirac integrality check (Wu-Yang) | L7.1 |
| `geometry::quantum_cohomology` | Frobenius/WDVV composition on toy manifolds (CPⁿ, Tⁿ, S²) + Riemann-Roch capacity | L7.5 / L7.7 |
| `geometry::toeplitz` | Berezin-Toeplitz operators with `ℏ ≥ 4 / embedding_dim` safety gate | L7.6 |
| `geometry::moment_map` | `MomentMap` + `InfinitesimalAction`; B-symplecticity validated; `measure_conservation` integrates Hamilton's equations and reports drift of `μ_ξ` along H-flow plus the pointwise invariance residual — Noether's "if and only if" both halves | L9 |
| `geometry::generative_flow` | `GenerativeFlow` keystone for the brain-primitives catalog: the SDE `ẋ = -∇H dt + √(2T) dW` (gradient half) and `ẋ = B⁻¹∇H` (Hamiltonian half) parametrized to deliver SAMPLE / FORECAST / DREAM / RECONSTRUCT as four boundary conditions on one generator. Convenience constructor `from_isotropic_gaussian()` plugs into L4's Welford stats so any bundle becomes a Friston-style generative model | L10 |
| `geometry::predictive_coding` | Three more brain primitives stacked on L10: `inpaint()` (constrained Langevin — lock some fields, sample the rest from the conditional density), `predict_one_step()` + `predict_one_step_natural()` (single Fisher-natural-gradient forward step — the brain's online predictive-coding update), `kernel_density_confidence()` + `confidence_normalized()` (kernel-density-estimate "I don't know" signal — separates known patients from out-of-cohort queries by 184 orders of magnitude in the demo) | L11 |
| `geometry::attention` + `geometry::memory` | Closes the brain-primitives catalog with the attention + memory pillar. `attend()` (softmax over `-‖q-x‖²/2σ²` — identical to a normalized Gaussian kernel), `focus()` (top-k attended → sub-bundle), `episodic_events()` (persistent-H₀ change-point detection via elder-rule on the sorted-values MST), `semantic_gist()` (wraps `BundleStore::morse_compress` under the brain-API name) | L12 |
| `geometry::bundle_stats` | One-pass Welford per-field empirical statistics — mean, std, min/max for numeric (with Bessel-corrected length-scale fallbacks for degenerate fields), value→count for categorical, component-wise mean + mean pairwise L2 length scale for Vector fields. Single source of truth for "what's a typical distance in this bundle" — feeds every Kähler-natural normalization downstream. Domain-agnostic by construction. | SUDOKU foundation |
| `geometry::sudoku` | The SUDOKU meta-primitive — `solve_constraints()` with the honest-coverage `Sat/Unsat/Unknown` tristate. Per-violation Kähler-natural `relaxation_cost`, per-constraint `K_c` curvature + selectivity, Pareto frontier of multi-violation near-misses, data-driven `RelaxationOption` menu sorted by gain/cost, Čech-style `check_constraint_holonomy()` pre-flight contradiction detection (O(C²), zero false positives), S3.5 `attempt_expansion()` for UNSAT puzzle relaxation. 41 unit tests + 6 HTTP wire-gate tests + 8 worked-example demos across 24 domains. | Waves 3–6.2, S3.5 |
| `geometry::sample_transport` | Curvature-bounded neighborhood sampling: `sample_transport_neighborhood()` with `d² = (1-cos θ)/2 ∈ [0,1]` half-angle formula, Efraimidis-Spirakis weighted-sampling-without-replacement (`r^(1/w)` priorities, top-k), exp(-β·d²) kernel, per-candidate `curvature_k = 2·√d²`, bundle-wide `confidence = 1/(1+κ)`. 13 geometry tests + 3 HTTP wire-gate + 4-domain worked example. | S4 |
| `graph::adjacency` | Dual principal/auxiliary adjacency operators | L2 |
| `graph::commutativity` | Group-algebra-centrality commutativity classifier | L2 |
| `cost::jacobi_estimator` | Jacobi-field cardinality bounds via Bishop / Günther | L3 |
| `discrete::hodge_complex` | `d_0` / `d_1` operators built from cell incidence; `d² = 0` enforced | L6 |
| `discrete::hodge_laplacian` | Δ_k = d†d + dd†, Betti via eigendecomposition | L6 |
| `discrete::morse` | Algebraic Morse compression; preserves cohomology | L6 |

### Binaries (`src/bin/` + `examples/`)

| Binary | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `gigi-server` | The cloud-hosted database — REST + WebSocket on port `3142` |
| `gigi-stream` | Streaming ingestion + subscription daemon (deployed at `gigi-stream.fly.dev`) |
| `gigi-edge` | Local-first edge node (mobile / on-device) |
| `gigi-convert` | CLI: JSON / CSV / SQL → DHOOM bundle |
| `gigi-stress` | Load + correctness stress harness |
| `nasa_atmo` | End-to-end NASA-atmosphere demo (`examples/nasa_atmosphere.rs`) |
| `kahler_tour` | One-run walk through every Kähler layer L1–L11 + DHOOM round-trip + PR-window endpoints, with concrete inputs / outputs / catalog refs. Requires `--features kahler`. (`examples/kahler_tour.rs`) |
| `predictive_coding_demo` | L11 INPAINT / PREDICT / SELF-MONITOR exercised on a real `BundleStore` holding 80 synthetic MIRADOR-style PK records. The SELF-MONITOR signal cleanly separates known patients from out-of-cohort queries by **184 orders of magnitude**. Requires `--features kahler`. (`examples/predictive_coding_demo.rs`) |
| `attention_memory_demo` | L12 ATTEND / FOCUS / EPISODIC / SEMANTIC on two real `BundleStore` scenarios: a 12-token semantic-embedding bundle (ATTEND correctly surfaces the 4 animals when queried with a cat-like embedding; FOCUS picks exactly the 3 vehicles for a vehicle-like query) and a 60-day PRISM-style transaction stream (EPISODIC detects a regime change at **1711× persistence ratio**). Requires `--features kahler`. (`examples/attention_memory_demo.rs`) |

### Theory & specs

The repo carries the math (`theory/*.tex`) and the build-ready specs alongside the
code so a reviewer can read the claim and the implementation in the same place:

- `GIGI_SPEC_v0.1.md` — the formal mathematical foundation (definitions 1.1 – 4.x)
- `GIGI_GEOMETRIC_ENCRYPTION_SPEC.md` + `GIGI_ENCRYPT_v0.2_SPRINT_SPEC.md` + `GIGI_ENCRYPT_v0.3_SPRINT_SPEC.md` + [`theory/encryption/GIGI_ENCRYPT_v0.4_SPRINT_SPEC.md`](theory/encryption/GIGI_ENCRYPT_v0.4_SPRINT_SPEC.md) — gauge encryption v0.2 → v0.3 (full delegation family + aggregate inversion) → v0.4 (invariant verification + credentials + K-preserving characterization + geodesic-ball membership)
- [`theory/encryption/paper_geometric_encryption_v0.1.tex`](theory/encryption/paper_geometric_encryption_v0.1.tex) — the load-bearing encryption paper (Aff(ℝ) trusted-delegatee model + pairing-PRE BDH-hard delegation + threshold lattice delegation; honest carveouts for Probabilistic MIN/MAX/RANGE bias and threshold-vs-PRE trust-model dependence)

- `GIGI_PRODUCT_SPECS.md` — the three-product surface (Convert · Stream · Edge)
- `GQL_SPECIFICATION.md` + `GQL_REFERENCE.md` + `GQL_ADDENDUM_v2.1.md` — the query language
- [`GIGI_LANG_SPEC.md`](GIGI_LANG_SPEC.md) — natural-language → GQL → fiber response (v0.1.1)
- [`GIGI_SCHEMA_INTROSPECTION_SPEC.md`](GIGI_SCHEMA_INTROSPECTION_SPEC.md) — public `/schema` endpoint with `@public` / `@gated` directive policy
- [`theory/kahler_upgrade/`](theory/kahler_upgrade/) — the Kähler upgrade catalog (16/21 items shipped through L1–L9) + per-layer implementation plan + Marcella substrate spec + Python validation suites + cross-team correspondence
- [`theory/post_kahler_directions/`](theory/post_kahler_directions/) — companion catalog: nine **post-Kähler** geometric programs from outside the Adachi lineage (Sasaki / contact, information geometry, optimal transport / Wasserstein, persistent homology, Gromov δ-hyperbolicity, tropical geometry, synthetic DG, noncommutative geometry, CAT(κ)). Same template — claim, proof sketch, validation status, applications, implementation pointers. 30/30 numerical checks pass.

---

## Quick start

### Run the server

```bash
cargo run --release --bin gigi-server
# → http://localhost:3142
```

### Create a bundle, insert, query (Python)

```python
from gigi import GigiClient
db = GigiClient("http://localhost:3142")

db.create_bundle("sensors",
    fields={"sensor_id": "categorical", "temp": "numeric", "humidity": "numeric"},
    keys=["sensor_id"])

db.insert("sensors", [
    {"sensor_id": "S-001", "temp": 22.5, "humidity": 60.1},
    {"sensor_id": "S-002", "temp": 19.3, "humidity": 71.4},
])

# Every read carries curvature + confidence
result = db.query("SECTION sensors AT (sensor_id='S-001');")
```

### GQL — a few of the geometric verbs

```gql
-- Point query — O(1) via the GIGI hash
SECTION sensors AT (sensor_id='S-001');

-- Aggregate over a base-space cover — O(|r|)
INTEGRATE temp OVER sensors COVER ALL;

-- Curvature of the bundle
CURVATURE sensors;

-- Spectral connectivity (Fiedler value)
SPECTRAL sensors;

-- Local Laplacian eigenmodes in a fiber subspace
SPECTRAL corpus ON FIBER (f11, f12) MODES 5;

-- Holonomy: how much does the fiber rotate around a categorical loop?
HOLONOMY corpus ON FIBER (f11, f12) AROUND tense_label;

-- Parallel transport between two records — explicit SO(2) rotation matrix
TRANSPORT corpus FROM (token_str='walk') TO (token_str='walked')
  ON FIBER (f11, f12);

-- Betti numbers — sheaf cohomology
BETTI sensors;

-- Encrypted-at-rest fiber, gauge-preserving
CREATE BUNDLE finance FIBER (
  amount NUMERIC ENCRYPTED,
  account TEXT ENCRYPTED INDEXED
);
-- κ, λ₁, anomaly detection still work — at native speed
```

See `GQL_REFERENCE.md` for the complete grammar (status table, complexity per verb,
EMIT / wire format options).

### Kähler-substrate HTTP endpoints (`gigi-stream`, deployed)

For downstream consumers that want the geometric primitives directly over
HTTP, `gigi-stream` exposes four endpoints under `/v1/` (added in the
PR-window sprint for Marcella's Hopf + Riemann-Roch wiring; wire shapes
pinned by [`tests/kahler_pr_window_marcella_contract.rs`](tests/)):

| Endpoint | What it does | Catalog |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /v1/quantum_cohomology/compose` | Frobenius / WDVV composition on toy manifolds (CPⁿ, Tⁿ, S²) | §2.10 |
| `POST /v1/quantum_cohomology/capacity` | Riemann-Roch capacity — `dim H⁰(L^k)` | §2.2 |
| `POST /v1/bundles/{name}/holonomy_debt` | Davis non-decoupling — `Quantized(n)` vs `Continuous(x)` | §E.1 |
| `POST /v1/bundles/{name}/flat_transport` | Classical / magnetic parallel transport with `BSource` selector | §1.5 |

Plus the brain-primitives surface (`POST /v1/bundles/{name}/brain/*`, content-negotiated DHOOM ↔ JSON, all polymorphic over heap and mmap+overlay bundles per #107):

| Endpoint | What it returns | Layer |
|---|---|---|
| `/brain/sample` | Friston-FEP Langevin samples from `p ∝ exp(-H)` | L10 |
| `/brain/dream`, `/forecast`, `/reconstruct` | SAMPLE variants under different boundary conditions | L10 |
| `/brain/inpaint` | Constrained Langevin — lock some fields, sample the rest | L11 |
| `/brain/predict` | Single Fisher-natural-gradient step | L11 |
| `/brain/confidence`, `/confidence_with_explain` | Kernel-density confidence + nearest-record explain path | L11 (Marcella refuse-gate) |
| `/brain/attend`, `/focus` | Softmax over geodesic distance + top-k sub-bundle | L12 |
| `/brain/episodic` | Persistent-H₀ change-point detection | L12 |
| `/brain/semantic` | Morse-compressed gist | L12 |
| `/brain/explain` | Interpolation path to nearest known record | L12 |
| `/brain/fit_diagnostics`, `/distance_to_fit_mean` | Σ eigenstructure + Mahalanobis distance to fit mean | wave 1 |
| `/brain/sudoku` | Constrained inference — see SUDOKU section above | waves 3–6.2, S3.5 |
| `/brain/sample_transport` | Curvature-bounded neighborhood sampling | S4 |

### One-shot tour of every shipped Kähler layer

```bash
cargo run --release --features kahler --bin kahler_tour
```

Walks L1 (J, B), L1.5 (transport), L2 (adjacency commutativity), L3 (Jacobi
cardinality), L4 (Kähler curvature decomposition), L5 (Hadamard detection),
L6 (Hodge + Morse), L7 (line bundle, holonomy debt, quantum cohomology,
Toeplitz, Riemann-Roch capacity), L9 (moment map / Noether), plus the
DHOOM array-of-primitives round-trip and a summary of the four PR-window
endpoints. Each section prints concrete inputs and outputs with catalog
references. Source at [`examples/kahler_tour.rs`](examples/kahler_tour.rs).

## Build, test, run

```bash
# Build everything (engine + 5 production bins + 3 benches + 2 examples)
cargo build --release
cargo build --release --features kahler   # adds the kahler_tour example bin

# Run the full test suite — unit + integration tests in src/ and tests/
cargo test --release

# Run benches
cargo run --release --bin bench_o1
cargo run --release --bin bench_ingest
cargo run --release --bin bench_tpch

# E2E against a running gigi-server
cd e2e && npm install && npm test
```

As of this README the engine ships with:

- **680 tests passing, 0 failed** on the default build (no `kahler` feature) — byte-equal to pre-Kähler-upgrade GIGI by the optionality contract (was 674 pre-SUDOKU; +6 from the wave-2 + #107 work that's structural enough to run feature-off).
- **909 tests passing, 0 failed** with `cargo test --lib --features kahler` (+ 64 in `cargo test --bin gigi-stream --features kahler`) — adds the twelve-layer Kähler stack (L1–L12, all 12 brain primitives operational), the SUDOKU meta-primitive (waves 3–6.2 + S3.5), SAMPLE_TRANSPORT (S4), the #107 polymorphic brain-endpoint fix, per-layer real-data smokes against the 20-record sensor dataset, the cross-team contract tests pinning each consumer-facing API shape, and six new HTTP wire-gate tests verifying that every wave-3/4/5/6 field reaches the response and the Čech pre-flight + Pareto + expansion paths return correctly.

The Python validation suites independently verify the math from three
independent angles:

- `theory/kahler_upgrade/validation/*.py` — 15/15 PASS across v1–v4
  (Adachi commutativity, magnetic trajectory, Hadamard-Cartan,
  trajectory-ball volume, moment map, spectral gap, prequantization
  integrality, Frobenius/WDVV, index theorem, Berezin-Toeplitz, Hodge
  cohomology, Kähler curvature decomposition, quantized holonomy debt,
  DHOOM Chern round-trip).
- `theory/post_kahler_directions/validation_tests.py` — 30/30 PASS
  across the nine post-Kähler directions (Sasaki Reeb characterization,
  Fisher metric on Gaussians, Wasserstein W₂, MST persistence,
  Gromov-δ closed forms, tropical fundamental theorem, dual-number
  derivatives, Connes distance on S¹, CAT(κ) comparison inequality).

## Geometric encryption (Encrypt v0.2 → v0.3 → v0.4)

`src/crypto.rs` + the v0.3/v0.4 modules (`integrity`, `aggregate_helpers`,
`delegation` family, `ratchet`, `ledger`, `threshold`, `invariant_verify`,
`credentials`, `invariant_ring`, `membership_index`) ship **gauge
encryption** — the structure group of the fiber bundle is itself the
cipher. The result is encryption that preserves every geometric
quantity GIGI computes:

| Quantity | Plaintext | Encrypted | Match? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scalar curvature K | ✓ | ✓ | exact |
| Confidence 1/(1+K) | ✓ | ✓ | exact |
| Capacity C = τ/K | ✓ | ✓ | exact |
| Spectral gap λ₁ | ✓ | ✓ | exact (graph-topology invariant) |
| Anomaly scores | ✓ | ✓ | exact |
| Holonomy δφ | ✓ | ✓ | exact (gauge-invariant — including HOLONOMY ON FIBER) |
| WHERE / range comparisons | ✓ | ✓ | preserved order on numeric fields |
| SUM / AVG / VAR / STDDEV | ✓ | ✓ | **plaintext-exact via O(1) client-side closed-form inverse** (v0.3 `aggregate_helpers`) |
| MIN / MAX / RANGE under Affine | ✓ | ✓ | exact |
| MIN / MAX / RANGE under Probabilistic σ>0 | ✓ | ✗ | refused at API (`BiasedUnderProbabilisticNoise`); `*_unchecked` opt-in if you accept the `Θ(σ √(2 log n) / \|a\|)` bias |
| **π_inv fingerprint** (K, λ₁, ⟨Hol⟩, τ, β₀, β₁) | ✓ | ✓ | **publicly verifiable, no gauge key required** (v0.4 Sprint N) |

**Six v0.2 gauge modes** + **v0.3 delegation family** + **v0.4 verification**:

| Layer | Primitives |
|---|---|
| **v0.2 gauge** | IDENTITY, AFFINE (numeric `v ↦ a·v + b`), PROBABILISTIC (Affine + i.i.d. Gaussian noise), OPAQUE (AES-256-GCM-SIV — random-access ciphertext, no equality leakage), INDEXED (AES-256-CMAC PRF — deterministic for indexed lookups, equality leaks by design), ISOMETRIC (O(k) rotation on Vector fields) |
| **v0.3 integrity** | Curvature-MAC (HMAC-SHA256 over canonical π_inv tuple; 10⁻¹⁰ quantization; 4× tighter than v0.3.0) |
| **v0.3 aggregate inversion** | Client-side closed-form decoders for SUM / AVG / VAR / STDDEV exact on Affine + Probabilistic; MIN / MAX / RANGE exact on Affine; honest refusal on Probabilistic σ>0 |
| **v0.3 audit log** | RFC 6962 Merkle holonomy ledger (gauge-invariant) |
| **v0.3 forward secrecy** | HKDF-chain RG-flow ratchet on the integrity key |
| **v0.3 delegation family** | J.1 Aff(ℝ) capability composition · J.2 BLS12-381 pairing PRE (DLP_G₂-hard, pre-quantum) · J.3 ML-KEM-768 trusted-delegatee (FIPS 203, NIST Level 3 PQ) · J.4 lattice threshold = Shamir K-of-N over F_p × per-share ML-KEM (info-theoretic on ≤K-1 subsets + PQ outer layer) |
| **v0.3 secret sharing** | Shamir over secp256k1 base field F_p (Sprint L); the primitive J.4 composes |
| **v0.4 Sprint N** | Public deterministic invariant-tuple verification; `POST /v1/bundles/{name}/verify_invariant`; bundle-id binding; `Verified` / `BundleMismatch` / `Rejected{field}` verdicts |
| **v0.4 Sprint O** | Credential-gated invariant queries (HMAC-bound today; BBS+ pinned as v0.5 unlinkability upgrade) |
| **v0.4 Sprint Q** | K-preserving subgroup characterized as the diagonal affine group `(ℝ*)ᵏ ⋉ ℝᵏ`; rotation-invariant `tr(Cov)/diam²` (corrects earlier `(max−min)²` overclaim); LWE separation as hiding-vs-gauge layers. **Roadmap only** — not a shipped PQ mode |
| **v0.4 Sprint P** | Geodesic-ball Mahalanobis membership index with dimension-aware χ² threshold (table-exact for k ∈ {1..5} × p ∈ {0.95, 0.99}; Wilson-Hilferty fallback elsewhere). Explicit leakage scope: not a hiding primitive |

**Rigor** (cross-team review-driven, locked in by tests):

- 25 Rust integration tests in `tests/fhe_pq_parity_rigor.rs`
- 12 Rust integration tests in `tests/invariant_verify_v0_4.rs`
  (including end-to-end through real `EncryptionMode::Affine` and
  `EncryptionMode::Indexed` write paths under multiple gauge seeds)
- 6 + 6 + 5 Rust integration tests for Sprints O / P / Q
- Python oracle `validation_tests_fhe_pq_rigor.py` (66/66 assertions)
- Python oracle `validation_tests_v0_4_sprint_n.py` (17/17 assertions)
- Paper [`theory/encryption/paper_geometric_encryption_v0.1.tex`](theory/encryption/paper_geometric_encryption_v0.1.tex)
  with two review-driven honest carveouts (§1.4 FHE parity scope; §1.4
  threshold-vs-PRE trust-model dependence)

All NIST-standardized primitives, all from the RustCrypto suite +
`bls12_381` + `ml-kem` + `hkdf` + `num-bigint`. Specs:

## What plugs into GIGI

- **Marcella** (NLP) — first consumer of the Kähler substrate. Runtime reads
  `BundleStore::kahler_curvature` / `spectral_gap_cached` / `hadamard_regions`
  / `morse_compress` / `transport_along` / `holonomy_debt` and surfaces them
  in self-inspect alongside a non-associativity meter that doubles as a
  conversation-stationarity signal. Refuse-gate hits `/brain/confidence_with_explain`
  every conversational turn — now survives server restarts cleanly via the
  #107 polymorphic adapter. Substrate spec:
  [`theory/kahler_upgrade/marcella_substrate.md`](theory/kahler_upgrade/marcella_substrate.md).
  Cross-team correspondence (8 letters) lives alongside it.
- **KRAKEN** (sensor fusion) — DAS / sonar / SAT / SIGINT bundles, CUSUM state, decisions, audit log, operator judgments — all on GIGI.
- **ICARUS** — sprint deliverables across `Transport`, `Holonomy`, `GaugeTest`, `SpectralFiber`, and `Divergence` verbs.
- **DHOOM** (`src/dhoom.rs`) — the canonical wire protocol used by every client.
- **GIGI Lang** — natural-language → GQL → fiber-shaped response. Spec at
  [`GIGI_LANG_SPEC.md`](GIGI_LANG_SPEC.md); SDK skeleton at
  [`sdk/python/gigi/lang.py`](sdk/python/gigi/lang.py) with contract tests
  pinning the shape; schema introspection at
  [`GIGI_SCHEMA_INTROSPECTION_SPEC.md`](GIGI_SCHEMA_INTROSPECTION_SPEC.md).
- **sudoky-energy** (sibling project, not in this repo) — Bee Davis's
  GPU-accelerated CSP solver (U.S. Provisional Patent Feb 2026). Solves
  the world's hardest 9×9 Sudoku puzzles in 20–49 ms on a single laptop
  GPU; **260,042 puzzles/sec** batch throughput. Shares the Davis-manifold
  machinery with GIGI's SUDOKU primitive: same `K_loc` curvature
  scheduling signal, same `V(c) = ∫_{R_c} K_loc dV_g` information value
  for ordering, same Γ trichotomy parameter for difficulty classification,
  same Čech `H̆¹` holonomy obstruction for pruning. sudoky-energy solves
  canonical CSPs; GIGI's SUDOKU applies the same machinery to bundle-
  record filtering. The cross-reference is documented in
  [`theory/kahler_upgrade/SUDOKU_PRIMITIVE_SPEC.md`](theory/kahler_upgrade/SUDOKU_PRIMITIVE_SPEC.md).

## Project status

Active. The engine is the substrate for several Davis Geometric products
(KRAKEN, Marcella, ICARUS, the Just-Gigi creator stack). Sprints land in
the open with TDD: each spec carries a v0.x section that maps to a passing
test in `cargo test`, and each landing-page claim is tied to a spec
section.

**Not in this README** are runtime data, the operational deploy workflow, and
operator-only restore tooling — those live in private channels.
