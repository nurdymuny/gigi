//! Kähler-geometry substrate for GIGI.
//!
//! Implements the generator 𝒢 = (M, g, J, ∇, B, Γ) from
//! `theory/kahler_upgrade/catalog.md §1` — Kähler manifold with
//! metric, complex structure, Chern connection, closed 2-form
//! perturbation, and graph discretization preserving the J/∇ split.
//!
//! Layering (see `theory/kahler_upgrade/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`):
//! - **L1** (here): foundation — `ComplexStructure` (J), `TwoForm` /
//!   `ClosedTwoForm` (B), `KahlerStructure` wrapping both. Wired into
//!   `BundleSchema` as an `Option` so non-Kähler bundles compile and
//!   run identically.
//! - **L2** (`graph::adjacency`): dual principal/auxiliary adjacency
//!   operators with the centrality-based commutativity check
//!   (catalog §1.1).
//! - **L3** (`cost::jacobi_estimator`): trajectory-ball cardinality
//!   bounds via Jacobi-field integration (catalog §1.3, §1.4, §1.5).
//! - **L4** (`bundle::KahlerCurvature`): Ricci / Weyl /
//!   holo-bisectional / holo-sectional decomposition (catalog §E.3).
//! - **L5** (`geometry::hadamard`): Hadamard substructure detection
//!   (catalog §1.4, §1.5).
//! - **L6** (`discrete::hodge_complex`): discrete Hodge theory
//!   (catalog §2.9).
//! - **L7** (`geometry::line_bundle`): prequantization + Chern-class
//!   compression (catalog §2.1, §E.1, §E.2).
//! - **L9** (`geometry::moment_map`): moment maps + Noether
//!   conservation along Hamiltonian B-flows (catalog §2.3).
//!   Retrofit of the L1.1 placeholder that didn't land first time;
//!   ships independently because it only depends on L1's
//!   `ClosedTwoForm`.
//! - **L10** (`geometry::generative_flow`): generative flow on the
//!   Kähler bundle — Sudoku-10× keystone for the brain-primitives
//!   catalog. Implements `ẋ = B⁻¹ ∇(-log p) + √(2T) dW` and
//!   parametrizes its boundary conditions to deliver SAMPLE,
//!   FORECAST, DREAM, RECONSTRUCT as one piece of infrastructure.
//!   See `theory/brain_primitives/catalog.md`.
//! - **L11** (`geometry::predictive_coding`): three more brain
//!   primitives — INPAINT (constrained Langevin), PREDICT (single
//!   Fisher-natural-gradient step), SELF-MONITOR (kernel-density
//!   confidence). Stack on top of L10's flow infrastructure.
//! - **L12** (`geometry::attention` + `geometry::memory`): closes
//!   the brain-primitives catalog. ATTEND (softmax over distance),
//!   FOCUS (top-k sub-bundle), EPISODIC (persistent-H₀ change-point
//!   detection), SEMANTIC (Morse-compressed gist).
//!
//! L1 — this module — only declares the foundation types. Subsequent
//! layers live in their own modules and depend on what we publish
//! from here.
